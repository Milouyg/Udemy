# Udemy mimic

# What do you read in this file?
For the final assignment from Front-end I had to mimic the website "Udemy." Udemy is an online learning and teaching marketplace. Instead of using their content, I have to use the content about gaming.
You will see the Index.html what I tried to make as much semantic as possible and I use the BEM methode.
I also use a little bit Javascript and scss within different components and abstract.

# What is BEM?
Bem is a Methodology you can use in your projects, it will benefit from the advantages of more structured CSS and UI. Bem stands for: Blocks, Elements and Modifiers. The main idea behind it, is to speed up the development process and ease the teamwork of developers by arraging CSS classes into independent modules.

# What is scss?
Sass is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world.
Sass has features that don't exist in css yet for example nesting, mixins and other useful stuff. It helps you write maintainable css.

# How to use scss?
You have to install Sass, tell Sass which file to build from and where to output CSS to. The most direct way to make this happen is in your terminal. 

for example:
If I want to run sass in my Udemy project, I type the following in my command prompt:<br>
```sass scss/style.scss css/style.css --watch```<br><br>
```--watch``` looks for all the changes what is made in the file and compile CSS to the public/stylesheets folder.
